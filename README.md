## Contributions

Starter code was provided by: <br>
Xander Rapstine: https://github.com/Xandromus <br>

Instruction was provided by Instructor Saurav with assistance from TAs Andreas #1, Andreas #2, Constan, and Morgan. 

Additionally, I leaned heavily on the code-base provided to students in 28-Stu_Mini-Project - tailoring some of its code to our assignment. My purpose was to further familize myself with the recommended modular directory structure and the use of arrow functions to accomplish the backend assignment functionality.

## Tests

The Project may tested running 'node server.js'and then opening <http://localhost:3001> in any browser. Please see the Demonstration Video above for a walkthrough.
